We will document our progress on the project, it is divided in 4 sprints and at the end of the course we will be able to build an application and get it up and running.. 
In other words we will deliver a CI/CD pipeline.



Along the journey of completing these sprints comes knowledge about:  
* [Version Control (Github)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
* [Bash](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash)
* [Backend](https://techterms.com/definition/backend)
* [Vim](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/vim-getting-started/)
* To be continued..
